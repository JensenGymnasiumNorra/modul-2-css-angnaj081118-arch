<h1 class="h11">Reverse: 1999 is a 20th Century Time-Travel Strategic RPG developed by Bluepoch. As the Timekeeper, observer of eras, you are free to travel through these eras after each "Storm." With the aid of Sonetto, a powerful Arcanist and ally from the Foundation, your mission is to travel through eras to where the "Storm" is most active, find other Arcanists who can sense the coming "Storm," and save them from being "sifted out" of the timeline. 
</h1> <h1 class="h11">This webpage includes my favourite characters along with the Timekeeper (Vertin) which you (the player) are controlling throughout the game.</h1>
