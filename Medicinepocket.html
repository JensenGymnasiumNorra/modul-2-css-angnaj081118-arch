<p class="Item1textMP">An identity card given to every researcher by Laplace. There are nothing strange or special about the layout and the color. The interviewee has put a sticker on it and finds that "humorous."</p>
<p class="Item2textMP">A pair of durable and breathable white gloves brought from the interviewee's hometown. With these gloves, the interviewee can safely make contact with all kinds of potions during their act of sabotage.</p>
<p class="Item3textMP">A sophisticated device connecting the interviewee's body and their wand. After the interviewee takes their medicine, it monitors their physical condition and draws their body fluids (blood, sweat, tear, etc.) for analysis. Besides, it can also congeal the fluids into bullets which will be fired by the wand in battle.</p>
